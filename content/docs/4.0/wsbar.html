<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This document describes why the internal workspace bar is minimal and how an
external workspace bar can be used. It explains the concepts using <tt>i3-wsbar</tt>
as the reference implementation.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_internal_and_external_bars">1. Internal and external bars</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The internal workspace bar of i3 is meant to be a reasonable default so that
you can use i3 without having too much hassle when setting it up. It is quite
simple and intended to stay this way. So, there is no way to display your own
information in this bar (unlike dwm, wmii, awesome, …).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We chose not to implement such a mechanism because that would be duplicating
already existing functionality of tools such as dzen2, xmobar and similar.
Instead, you should disable the internal bar and use an external workspace bar
(which communicates with i3 through its IPC interface).</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_dock_mode">2. dock mode</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>You typically want to see the same workspace bar on every workspace on a
specific screen. Also, you don’t want to place the workspace bar somewhere
in your layout by hand. This is where dock mode comes in: When a program sets
the appropriate hint (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK), it will be managed in dock
mode by i3. That means it will be placed at the bottom of the screen (while
other edges of the screen are possible in the NetWM standard, this is not yet
implemented in i3), it will not overlap any other window and it will be on
every workspace for the specific screen it was placed on initially.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_ipc_interface">3. The IPC interface</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the context of using an external workspace bar, the IPC interface needs to
provide the bar program with the current workspaces and output (as in VGA-1,
LVDS-1, …) configuration. In the other direction, the program has to be able
to switch to specific workspaces.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By default, the IPC interface is enabled and places its UNIX socket in
<tt>~/.i3/ipc.sock</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To learn more about the protocol which is used for IPC, see <tt>docs/ipc</tt>.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_output_changes_on_the_fly">4. Output changes (on-the-fly)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>i3 implements the RandR API and can handle changing outputs quite well. So, an
external workspace bar implementation needs to make sure that when you change
the resolution of any of your screens (or enable/disable an output), the bars
will be adjusted properly.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_i3_wsbar_the_reference_implementation">5. i3-wsbar, the reference implementation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please keep in mind that <tt>i3-wsbar</tt> is just a reference implementation. It is
shipped with i3 to have a reasonable default. Thus, <tt>i3-wsbar</tt> is designed to
work well with dzen2 and there are no plans to make it more generic.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_big_picture">5.1. The big picture</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most common reason to use an external workspace bar is to integrate system
information such as what <tt>i3status</tt> provides into the workspace bar (to save
screen space). So, we have <tt>i3status</tt> or a similar program, which only provides
text output (formatted in some way). To display this text nicely on the screen,
there are programs such as dzen2, xmobar and similar. We will stick to dzen2
from here on. So, we have the output of i3status, which needs to go into dzen2
somehow. But we also want to display the list of workspaces. <tt>i3-wsbar</tt> takes
input on stdin, combines it with a formatted workspace list and pipes it to
dzen2.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please note that <tt>i3-wsbar</tt> does not print its output to stdout. Instead, it
launches the dzen2 instances on its own. This is necessary to handle changes
in the available outputs (to place a new dzen2 on a new screen for example).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">

</a>
</span></p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_running_i3_wsbar">5.2. Running i3-wsbar</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most simple usage of i3-wsbar looks like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>i3-wsbar -c "dzen2 -x %x -dock"</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <tt>%x</tt> in the command name will be replaced by the X position of the output
for which this workspace bar is running. i3 will automatically place the
workspace bar on the correct output when dzen2 is started in dock mode. The
bar which you will see should look exactly like the internal bar of i3.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To actually get a benefit, you want to give <tt>i3-wsbar</tt> some input:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>i3status | i3-wsbar -c "dzen2 -x %x -dock"</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is recommended to place the above command in your i3 configuration file
to start it automatically with i3.</p></div>
