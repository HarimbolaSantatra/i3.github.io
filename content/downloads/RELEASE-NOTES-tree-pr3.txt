Release notes for i3 tree-pr3
-----------------------------

This is the third PREVIEW RELEASE for the tree branch. It is *NOT* part of
i3’s regular releases and should *NOT* be packaged in the usual way for
distributions. Instead, provide a separate, unofficial package if possible.

The so called tree branch is the place where the next version of i3 is
developed. This time, we did a major code refactoring bringing many changes.
The idea is to use a tree as datastructure instead of separate lists (like one
for outputs, workspaces and a table for storing your window layout).

Quite a few advantages arise from this new data structure. The most prominent
ones will be a slightly different look and feel, the possibility to store your
layout and restore it later, correct resizing, a much cleaner command parser
and more little improvements.

As this is a preview release, some things are not working yet. Generally,
though, the core developers are using it already and think it’s good enough to
try it out. With this release, we want to gather feedback from you, so please
report any bugs you encounter in our bugtracker at http://bugs.i3wm.org/

What should be working in this release?

 • Basic window management, navigation, moving
