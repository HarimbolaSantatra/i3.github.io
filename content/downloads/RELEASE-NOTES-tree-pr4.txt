Release notes for i3 tree-pr4
-----------------------------

This is the fourth PREVIEW RELEASE for the tree branch. It is *NOT* part of
i3’s regular releases and should *NOT* be packaged in the usual way for
distributions. Instead, provide a separate, unofficial package if possible.

The so called tree branch is the place where the next version of i3 is
developed. This time, we did a major code refactoring bringing many changes.
The idea is to use a tree as datastructure instead of separate lists (like one
for outputs, workspaces and a table for storing your window layout).

Quite a few advantages arise from this new data structure. The most prominent
ones will be a slightly different look and feel, the possibility to store your
layout and restore it later, correct resizing, a much cleaner command parser
and more little improvements.

This release is considered a release candidate for i3 v4.0. We will not make
big changes and plan to release v4.0 in a few weeks.
With this release, we want to gather feedback from you, so please
report any bugs you encounter in our bugtracker at http://bugs.i3wm.org/
